;; OK, let's try to emit *some* VHDL from s-exp and see how far will it go...
;; The pattern for if (cond) would look something like

;; The second component is destructuring of initial list

;; Let's try something more complicated than if

;; Looks like I understand now how this destructuring should work
;; -- all the "variables" inside body should be grepped beforehand, and be "unbound" outside
;; -- we should not mix in dots (or any reader syntax) -- instead relying on "special forms" like CDR

;; OK, now we need to make emitting language equally flexible
